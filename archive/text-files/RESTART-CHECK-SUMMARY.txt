  POST-RESTART SYSTEM CHECK SUMMARY
  Date: 2025-12-16
========================================

CHECK RESULTS:
--------------
✅ Restart Detection: Working (flag file exists)
✅ Scheduled Tasks: 4 tasks configured and ready
✅ Exness Terminal: RUNNING (PID: 1808)
⚠️  Master Controller: Log file empty (may not be running)
⚠️  VPS Services: Status unclear (need verification)

WHAT WAS CHECKED:
-----------------
1. ✅ Restart flag file - EXISTS (restart was detected)
2. ✅ Scheduled tasks - All 4 tasks in Ready state
3. ✅ Exness Terminal - Running successfully
4. ⚠️  Master Controller - Started but log is empty
5. ⚠️  VPS Services - Need to verify if running

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
-----------------
The master controller requires admin privileges and may not be starting
properly even with RunAs. The log file is empty, suggesting it either:
- Failed to start
- Started but isn't logging
- Needs different elevation method

CURRENT STATUS:
---------------
🟢 Exness Terminal: OPERATIONAL
🟡 VPS Services: NEEDS VERIFICATION
🟡 Master Controller: UNCERTAIN

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
--------------------
1. Run full verification:
   .\vps-verification.ps1

2. If services aren't running, manually start:
   powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Users\USER\OneDrive\start-vps-system.ps1"

3. Check individual service logs in vps-logs\ directory

4. Monitor master-controller.log for activity

NEXT RESTART:
-------------
The system should work better because:
- Restart detection is working
- Scheduled tasks are configured
- Exness Terminal starts successfully
- Master controller may need adjustment for admin elevation

========================================
STATUS: PARTIALLY OPERATIONAL
