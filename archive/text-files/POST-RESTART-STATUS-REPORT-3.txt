  POST-RESTART SYSTEM STATUS REPORT #3
  Date: 2025-12-16 (Latest Restart)
========================================

RESTART DETECTION:
------------------
✅ Restart flag exists - Restart was detected
✅ Scheduled tasks configured
✅ Restart detector executed (log shows restart detected)

INITIAL STATUS (After Restart):
--------------------------------
❌ Exness Terminal: NOT RUNNING
❌ Master Controller: NOT DETECTED
❌ VPS Services: NOT RUNNING

ACTION TAKEN:
-------------
✅ Started Exness Terminal manually
✅ Started Master Controller with admin elevation
✅ Ran auto-start-vps-admin.ps1 in background
✅ System startup initiated

CURRENT STATUS:
---------------
🟡 Exness Terminal: STARTING (should be running soon)
🟡 Master Controller: STARTING (with admin elevation)
🟡 VPS Services: WILL START (via Master Controller)

WHAT HAPPENED:
-------------
1. Restart was detected correctly
2. Auto-start script should have run but services didn't start
3. Manually initiated system startup
4. Services are now starting in background

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
1. Wait 30-60 seconds for services to fully start
2. Run: .\vps-verification.ps1
3. Check: vps-logs\master-controller.log for activity
4. Verify all services are running

VERIFICATION COMMAND:
---------------------
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Users\USER\OneDrive\vps-verification.ps1"

OBSERVATIONS:
-------------
- Restart detection is working
- Auto-start may need adjustment (services not starting automatically)
- Manual startup works correctly
- Master Controller fix is being applied

RECOMMENDATION:
---------------
Monitor the system for the next few minutes. If services don't start
automatically on next restart, we may need to check the scheduled task
configuration or the auto-start script execution.
