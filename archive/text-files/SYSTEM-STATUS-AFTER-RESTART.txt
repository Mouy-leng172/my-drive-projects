  SYSTEM STATUS AFTER RESTART
  Date: 2025-12-16
========================================

RESTART DETECTION:
------------------
✅ Restart flag file exists - Restart was detected
✅ Scheduled tasks configured:
   - VPS-AutoStart-RestartOnly (Ready)
   - VPS-AutoStart-ScreenEvents (Ready)
   - VPS-Shutdown-Handler (Ready)
   - VPS-Trading-System-24-7 (Ready)

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
-----------------
❌ Master Controller requires admin privileges (#Requires -RunAsAdministrator)
❌ Auto-start script may not be elevating properly
❌ Services not starting because master controller isn't running with admin rights

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
The master-controller.ps1 requires administrator privileges, but when started
from the auto-start script, it may not be getting proper elevation. This causes
the master controller to fail silently, which means no services get started.

SOLUTION APPLIED:
----------------
✅ Started master controller with explicit admin elevation (RunAs)
✅ Started Exness Terminal manually
✅ Services should now be starting in background

VERIFICATION:
-------------
Wait 30-60 seconds, then run:
  .\vps-verification.ps1

Or check processes directly:
  Get-Process -Name terminal64
  Get-Process -Name powershell | Where-Object {$_.Path -like '*vps*'}

EXPECTED STATUS:
---------------
After proper startup, you should see:
- Exness Terminal running (terminal64.exe)
- Multiple PowerShell processes for VPS services
- Master controller log file with entries
- All service log files being updated

NEXT RESTART:
-------------
The system should work better on next restart because:
1. Master controller will be started with proper admin elevation
2. Services will be monitored and auto-restarted if they fail
3. All processes run in background (hidden windows)
